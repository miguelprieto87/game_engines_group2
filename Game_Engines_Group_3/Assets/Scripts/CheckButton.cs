    /* Note to Miguel and Mohammed:
     * I decided I'd rather wait for you guys before proceeding any further with this project
     * Instead I will explain what this script needs to do.
     * Essentially, it needs to use something like a Switch Statement in order to find  and create a case for each of the eight inventory buttons
     * Then it must convert that case into an int or something
     * And then you must find a way to carry that int over to the PanelPopulate script, 
     * So that it can check which button was pressed and then populate the content with the data from the corresponding List.
     * Ask me if you have any questions.
